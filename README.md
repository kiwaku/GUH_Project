## Epidemic Through Eras

Epidemic Through Eras is a time-travel-inspired virus spread simulator that models how a virus would propagate across different historical periods. Rather than focusing on gameplay, this simulation tool emphasizes accuracy, using historical data on transportation, population density, sanitation practices, and medical knowledge to visualize the spread of pathogens across time.

Key Features

	1.	Era-Based Simulation: Select from various time periods (e.g., Ancient Rome, Middle Ages, Industrial Era) with unique settings for transportation, urban density, hygiene, and public health practices.
	2.	Customizable Pathogens: Adjust parameters like contagion rate, incubation period, and symptoms, and observe how a virus performs in different eras.
	3.	Dynamic Visualization: Watch infection spread on a historical map, with real-time updates on infection rates, containment efforts, and recovery.
	4.	Simulated Historical Responses: View the impact of period-specific containment efforts like quarantines and sanitation improvements.
	5.	Outcome Analysis: Assess the results of virus spread under varying conditions and “What If” scenarios to explore alternative historical outcomes.

Technical Overview

	•	Frontend: Interactive map and UI using frameworks like React and Mapbox.
	•	Backend: Simulation engine built in Python to process virus dynamics.
	•	Data Integration: Uses historical data on demographics, transportation, and health practices, with predictive AI modeling to enhance accuracy.

Educational Value: This simulation provides insights into how historical conditions influenced pandemics, highlighting the evolution of public health practices over time.
